# Real SWE-bench result — `pallets/flask` #4045

A real run of the convergent review loop vs a single shot on an actual SWE-bench Lite
instance (the external, industry-standard benchmark), with `claude-codex` and the real
`FAIL_TO_PASS` / `PASS_TO_PASS` test oracle.

**Instance:** `pallets__flask-4045` — *"Raise error when blueprint name contains a dot."*
Materialized with `swebench/import.py` (clone @ base_commit + the hidden test_patch). The
environment needed the predicted per-instance pinning (`werkzeug==2.2.3`, `markupsafe==2.1.1`,
`pytest==7.1.2`) before flask would even import — the reason the official harness is Dockerized.

## Result

| config | resolved | iterations | catch-and-fix | tokens (in/out) | stop_reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **single-shot** (`--max-iters 1`) | ❌ **no** | 1 | no | 385k / 8.9k | max_iters |
| **loop** (`--max-iters 3`) | ✅ **yes** | 2 | ✅ **yes** | 766k / 13.9k | converged |

## What happened

- **Single shot:** Claude patched `blueprints.py`, Codex's review passed it — but the
  verifier **blocked**: of the two `FAIL_TO_PASS` tests, one passed and
  `test_route_decorator_custom_endpoint_with_dots` **still failed**. The one-shot fix was
  plausible-but-incomplete, and review did not catch it. Result: **unresolved.**
- **Loop:** the same incomplete fix landed in iteration 1; the **verify gate caught** the
  remaining test failure, that feedback went back to Claude, and **iteration 2 completed the
  fix** → both `FAIL_TO_PASS` pass, `PASS_TO_PASS` stay green → **converged, resolved.** The
  run recorded a `highlight` (`catch_and_fix=true`) — the "caught & fixed" moment.

## Official Docker verdict — RESOLVED ✅

Loope's loop-produced fix was extracted as a source-only prediction
([`swebench-flask-4045.patch`](swebench-flask-4045.patch)) and run through the **official
`swebench` harness in Docker** (the canonical oracle, not our ad-hoc pinned env):

```json
{ "submitted_instances": 1, "completed_instances": 1,
  "resolved_instances": 1, "unresolved_instances": 0,
  "resolved_ids": ["pallets__flask-4045"] }
```

So the win is **officially reproducible**, not an artifact of our local environment.

## Conclusion

On a real GitHub issue, **the review loop resolved what a single shot could not** — at ~2×
tokens and one extra iteration — the win is **directly attributable to the verify→repair
cycle** (`catch_and_fix=true`), and it is **confirmed by the official SWE-bench Docker
harness**. This is the regime the micro traps were too easy to reach (Claude solved those
single-shot 100%): the loop's value shows up exactly when the first attempt is
plausible-but-wrong and a gate catches it.

> One instance is an anecdote, not a rate — a published number needs many instances. But
> end-to-end, on real data and the official oracle, the thesis holds: **the harness's
> catch-and-fix loop turns an unresolved single shot into a resolved, officially-verified
> fix.**
